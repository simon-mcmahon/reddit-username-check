# reddit-username-check

Use this repository to check if english language words of specific length are taken as reddit usernames.
The purpose of this repo is to grab a cool reddit username!

The .json dictionary included is a slightly modified version of the text file contained [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/) .

## How to use

1. Clone the respoitory locally.
2. Modify the settings variables at the top of `username_check.py` to fit to your desired word.
3. Wait for the script to finish running
4. The available usernames will be in array called  `available` inside the sccript.

## Dependencies

Nothing. Just uses trusty old Python 3.X

## Disclaimers

I will not be maintaining this project. If it breaks, it breaks but it worked for a simple one and done script to find the available 4 letter lowercase english words left as valid usernames for me.
